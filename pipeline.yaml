# ==           README: MICROSERVICE CI/CD PIPELINE (Values File Model)             ==
# ===================================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# This file defines the complete CI/CD process for THIS specific microservice using
# the "Values File per Environment" strategy. This is the recommended and most
# robust architecture for managing configuration at scale.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1.  **Configuration in Files:** All environment-specific configuration (replicas,
#     namespaces, secrets, etc.) now lives in dedicated YAML files within the
#     `/helm-values` directory of this repository.
#
# 2.  **Pipeline as Orchestrator:** This pipeline's primary job is to orchestrate the
#     process. It determines which environment to deploy to (based on the Git branch)
#     and tells the deploy template which configuration file to use for that deployment.
#
# 3.  **Simple & Stable Templates:** It calls standardized, simple templates from the
#     central 'cicd-platform' for the actual build and deploy logic. This separates
#     the "what" (this file's configuration) from the "how" (the platform's logic).
#
# HOW TO CONFIGURE A NEW SERVICE:
# 1.  Copy this file into the root of the new microservice's repository.
# 2.  Create a `/helm-values` directory.
# 3.  Inside `/helm-values`, create a YAML file for each deployment target (e.g.,
#     `dev.yaml`, `qa-eastus.yaml`, `prod-westus.yaml`).
# 4.  Update the `variables` block in this file to match the new service's name
#     and point to the correct values files.
